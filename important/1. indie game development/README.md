# Indie Game Development

## **Indie Developers V.S. AAA Developers**
Indie game developers often consisting of a person or small teams with limited budgets.

AAA studios are large companies with a huge team and a bigger amount of resources than Indie developers.


## Project Life Cycle

### 1. **Initial Start**
   - Ask yourself, "What kind of game do you want to create?" "Should I create a dating simulator, an action rpg, or a open-ended gameplay?"
   - Indie developers only have limited resources. Define your scope of your project realistically. What can you achieve with your team size, time limit, and budget?

### 2. **Prototyping**
   - Create a small prototypeâ€”a playground where you can test mechanics, controls, and core gameplay.
   - Ask for feedback from friends, other developers, or your family. Use their feedback to help improve your game.

### 3. **Art and Sound**
   - Pixel art is indie-friendly. It's nostalgic, expressive, and is cheaper to make or buy.
   - You can use free/paid sounds/tunes from marketplaces or create your own sounds/tunes for the ambiance of your game.

### 4. **Clean Codes and Indie-Friendly Engines**
   - Keep your code clean and sloppy free.
   - Most popular engines among indie developers are Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, GameMaker Studio, Construct, RPG Maker, Defold, Phaser, and CryEngine.

### 5. **Marketing and Community**
   - Tease your game early and share concept art, developer logs, and behind-the-scenes of your game on social media.
   - Engage with players using platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, itch.io, and any social media platform you prefer.

### 6. **Release Day**
   - Release your game on platforms like Steam, itch.io, or any mobile app stores.
   - Receive feedback by engaging with your community.
