# Before you start
Before you start on the journey of **Godot game development**, you should lay a solid foundation. Here are some steps to consider:

### 1. **Learn the Basics**:
   - Familiarize yourself with Godot and understand the engine's interface, nodes, scenes, and scripting language (GDScript).
   - Start with using GDScript, the language used in Godot, by covering every aspect thoroughly.

### 2. **Plan Your Game**:
   - Define the core gameplay, mechanics, and overall theme of your game.
   - Create a design document that outlines the game's features, levels, characters, and art style.

### 3. **Set Up Your Workspace**:
   - Make sure Godot is downloaded and installed.
   - Set up a structured folder system for assets, scripts, and other resources.
   - Use Git or another version control system to track changes and collaborate effectively.

### 4. **Learn Game Mechanics**:
   - For beginners, start with a simple project to grasp the basics. Create a small game to understand Godot's workflow.
   - Explore common 2D game mechanics like movement, physics, and animations.

### 5. **Understand Game Assets**:
   - Learn about sprites, textures, sound effects, and music.
   - Familiarize yourself with tools like Aseprite, Krita, Blender, or other apps/tools for creating game assets.

### 6. **Learn About Game Design**:
   - Understand how games flow through different states (menus, gameplay, pause screens).
   - Study player habits, feedback, and engagement.
   - Continuously playtest and refine your game.

### 7. **Common Tasks**:
   - Write well-organized code and avoid spaghetti code.
   - Learn to troubleshoot issues efficiently.

### 8. **Collaborate and Seek Feedback**:
   - Connect with other Godot developers on forums, Discord, and other social media apps.
   - Share your progress, get feedback, and work on your game.

### 9. **Optimize**:
   - Use Godot's built-in profiler to identify bottlenecks, which refers to a part of your game where performance is hindered.
   - Fix textures and manage memory.

### 10. **Publish and Market Your Game**:
   - Decide on what platforms (PC, mobile, webpage) and distribution channels (Steam, itch.io, app stores) you want to use to publish your game.
   - Create a website, build a community, and showcase your game through trailers, screenshots, and social media.
