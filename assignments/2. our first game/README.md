# Our First Game

To most beginner game developers, It is always hard finding the right assets for their game or to make the assets for their game. So you have been provided some assets for you to get started on making a game.

Your task for this assignment is to build a small, **simple** sidescrolling game by yourself using the assets folder provided to you. Your game can be about anything that you would like it to be as long as your projects are original. The content also needs to be free of adult content, drug use, defamation, or bullying. You will be given 10 weeks to complete this project.

To clarify, **NO adult content, drug use, drug promotion, defamation, or bullying.** Breaking this rule, by adding any of them to the game or documentation, will **remove you from gaming club** immediately and may result in handbook actions such as **write ups** or **removal from Base Camp**.
