# Our First Game

To most beginner game developers, It is always hard finding the right assets for their game or to make the assets for their game. So you have been provided some assets for you to get started on making a game.

Your task for this assignment is to build a small game by yourself using the assets folder provided to you. Your game can be about anything that you would like it to be as long as the content is free of adult content, drug use, defamation, or bullying. You will be given 10 weeks to complete this project.

To clarify, **NO adult content, drug use, drug promotion, defamation, or bullying.** Breaking this rule by adding any of them to the game or documentation will **remove you from gaming club** and may result in handbook actions such as **write ups** or **removal from Base Camp**. 

## Dictionary:
1. **Adult Content**: Refers to material that is intended for an adult audience and typically includes sexually explicit or suggestive themes.
2. **Drug Use**: Refers to the consumption of substances that alter an individual's physical or mental state. This can include legal and illegal drugs.
3. **Drug Promotion**: Refers to the marketing and advertising of drugs, which can include both legal and illegal substances. 
4. **Defamation**: Refers to the act of making false statements about an real life person or entity that damage their reputation. 
5. **Bullying**: A repeated aggressive behavior that involves an imbalance of power or strength. It can take various forms, including physical, verbal, social, and cyberbullying.
