# Farming Game Tutorial

When people start out learning how to make games, they normally look up how to make a game. Some people even go into it not knowing the different genres of games. Tutorials are a good way to help with the learning process as long as the tutorial is actually helpful and your following along, or else, you could end up in a **"Tutorial Hell"**.

Your task for this assignment is to follow the tutorial in **[Resources](#resources)** to fully make your first game. Use this as a learning experience to learn the engine and the logic of Godot. You will be given 8 weeks to complete this project.

To clarify, **NO adult content, drug use, drug promotion, defamation, or bullying.** Breaking this rule, by adding any of them to the game or documentation, will **remove you from gaming club** immediately and may result in handbook actions such as **write ups** or **removal from Base Camp**. 

## Dictionary:
1. **Tutorial Hell**: Refers to a situation where learners become stuck in a cycle of endlessly following tutorials without applying what they've learned to create their own projects. 
2. **Adult Content**: Refers to material that is intended for an adult audience and typically includes sexually explicit or suggestive themes.
3. **Drug Use**: Refers to the consumption of substances that alter an individual's physical or mental state. This can include legal and illegal drugs.
4. **Drug Promotion**: Refers to the marketing and advertising of drugs, which can include both legal and illegal substances. 
5. **Defamation**: Refers to the act of making false statements about an real life person or entity that damage their reputation. 
6. **Bullying**: A repeated aggressive behavior that involves an imbalance of power or strength. It can take various forms, including physical, verbal, social, and cyber-bullying.
