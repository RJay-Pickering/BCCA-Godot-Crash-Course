# PARALLAX LAYERS
The use of parallax layers is a common technique for adding visual depth to 2D platformers, creating the illusion that background elements move at different speeds relative to the player. Here is how you can set up parallax layers in your 2D platformer in Godot 4.0:

**1. Resource Preparation:**

Before you begin, you must have the graphics assets for your parallax layers, such as images or background textures.

**2. Setting Parallax Layers:**

- In Godot, select the scene from your platformer in the Scene Tree.
- Add a "ParallaxBackground" node as a child node of the main scene.
- Add one or more "ParallaxLayer" nodes as children of the "ParallaxBackground" for each parallax layer you want to create.

**3. Setting Parallax Layers:**

- Select each "ParallaxLayer" node and set its texture (or sprite) in the Inspector.
- Adjust the "scroll_offset" and "scroll_scale" to control the movement of the layer in relation to the camera and the player.
  - "scroll_offset": This sets the initial position of the layer relative to the camera.
  - "scroll_scale": This sets the movement speed of the layer. A lower value will slow down the layer relative to the camera, creating the illusion of depth.

**4. Camera & Player:**

Make sure the camera is set to follow the player correctly. You can use a "Camera2D" node and set it to follow the main character.

**5. Testing and Adjusting:**

Run the game and adjust the settings of the parallax layers until you get the desired effect. You can experiment with different textures and travel speeds to create the desired sense of depth.

**6. Export:**

Make sure your parallax layers are set up correctly in the exporter so that they are included when you export the game to the desired platform.

Parallax layers can add an interesting visual dimension to your 2D platformer, making it more engaging for players. Keep in mind that practice and experimentation will help hone your skills in creating parallax layers for your game in Godot 4.0. Be sure to refer to the official Godot documentation for more details on using parallax layers in this release.
