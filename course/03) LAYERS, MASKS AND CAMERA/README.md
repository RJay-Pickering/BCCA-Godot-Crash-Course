# LAYERS, MASKS, AND CAMERA
Creating a 2D platformer in Godot 4.0 involves using layers, masks, and setting up the camera to create an interactive gaming environment. Here are the basic steps to create a 2D platformer with these elements:

**1. Setting Up Layers:**

Layers are used to organize elements in your platformer. You can use layers to separate characters, background objects, enemies, etc. To set up layers:

- In Godot, go to the "Project" menu and choose "Project Settings". 
- Under the "3D/2D" tab, you'll find the "Layer Names" section. Add relevant layers, such as "Background", "Characters", "Enemies", etc.

**2. Wearing masks:**

Masks are useful for defining collision relationships between objects. In the context of a 2D platformer, you can use masks to define where the character can walk, what objects can be interacted with, etc. To wear masks:

- On the object's node (for example, the floor node), navigate to the "CollisionShape2D" section in the Inspector. 
- Configure the layers that this object should collide with or interact with. 
- In the character node, configure the layers that the character should detect or collide.


**3. Creating the Character:**

- Create a node to represent the character (for example, a "KinematicBody2D" node). 
- Add a sprite for the character's appearance. 
- Add a CollisionShape2D for collision detection. 
- Set up the layers and masks for the character.

**4. Adding Movement to the Character:**

- Create a script for the character. 
- Implement movement logic, such as walking and jumping, into the script. 
- Be sure to deal with collisions with the ground and other objects.

**5. Setting up the camera:**

- Create a "Camera2D" node for the camera in your platformer. 
- Set the camera to follow the character or move according to the game's logic. 
- Adjust the size of the camera to suit your level.

**6. Creating Platform Objects:**

- Create platform objects (for example, using Tilemaps or instances of Area2D nodes). 
- Set up the layers and masks for the platforms. 
- Position the platforms in the level according to the game design.

**7. Implementing Game Logic:**

- Add enemies, collectibles, and other gameplay elements as needed. 
- Implement game logic such as scoring, objectives, and events.

Keep in mind that this is a general guide and that the specific details may vary based on your game's design. Godot 4.0 offers powerful features for creating 2D platformers, and the official documentation and tutorials specific to this version can be valuable resources for deepening your knowledge.
