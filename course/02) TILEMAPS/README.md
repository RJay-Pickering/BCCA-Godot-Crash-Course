# TILEMAPS 
Tilemaps are a key part of creating 2D games on engines like Godot, including version 4.0. They allow you to create scenarios or levels using a grid of pre-made tiles instead of manually creating each part of the level. Here are the basic steps to use Tilemaps in Godot 4.0+:

1. **Creating a Tileset:**
   - First, you need to create a Tileset, which is a collection of tiles that will be used in your Tilemap.
   - In Godot, go to the "Import" tab in the top right corner.
   - Import your images (the tiles) and arrange them in a Tileset.
   - Save the Tileset.

2. **Creating a Tilemap**: 
   - In your Scene Tree node, add a TileMap node (Node2D -> TileMap). 
   - In the Inspector, configure the Tileset you created for the Tilemap.

3. **Painting with Tiles:** 
   - With the Tilemap selected in the Scene Tree, you can start painting your scenery. 
   - Select a tile in the Tileset, choose the Painting tool, and start drawing on the Tilemap grid.

4. **Tilemap Settings:** 
   - In the Tilemap Inspector, you can adjust various settings, such as tile size, collisions (to create walkable areas and obstacles), rotation, mirroring, and other properties.

5. **Scripting and Logic:** 
   - You can add scripts to your Tilemap or any object in the Tilemap to create specific behaviors. For example, you can add logic for interactions with the tiles, enemies that move along the grid, etc.

6. **Layers:** 
   - Tilemaps support layers, allowing you to create backdrops with multiple levels, backgrounds, and decorative elements on different layers.

7. **Autotiles:** 
   - Godot 4.0 supports autotiles, which simplify the creation of terrain, such as roads or trees, using defined rules.

Keep in mind that Godot 4.0 may have some differences from previous versions, and it's important to refer to the official documentation or tutorials specific to version 4.0 for detailed information on how to work with Tilemaps in that version. 

Tilemaps are a powerful tool for speeding up 2D game development and creating levels efficiently. Experiment with creating and customizing them to your game's needs.
